A fast and easy to configure alternative to [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)
written in C and configured using Lua (still in a very early stage)!

> **IMPORTANT**: I'm a newbie using C and the Lua C API so if you see something wrong
> please let me know!

## Installation

You can grab the latest release from our [releases](https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/lcfetch/releases/latest)
or if you want to live in the bleeding-edge with the latest features you can [build from source](#building-from-source).

You will also need to install `lua5.3` if you do not have it installed.

> **NOTE**: lcfetch was tested only with Lua `5.3+` but should work as expected with earlier
> Lua versions.

### Building from source

#### Installing dependencies

The Lua packages listed below are optional because lcfetch will download `Lua 5.3.6` locally
by default in order to avoid installing extra stuff in your system.

##### Ubuntu

```sh
apt install lua5.3 liblua5.3-dev libx11-dev libreadline-dev
```

##### Fedora

```sh
dnf install lua lua-devel libX11-devel readline-devel
```

#### Arch

```sh
pacman -S lua53 libx11 readline
```

> **NOTE**: isn't your distro covered here but you know the exact packages names? Please
> send a Pull Request!

---

Now that you have the system-wide dependencies you can proceed to build and install lcfetch!

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/lcfetch.git \
    && cd lcfetch
```

For speeding up things, you can simply use our [Makefile](./Makefile).

The Makefile `build` target (the default one) will automatically download the required
third-party dependencies for building lcfetch (`log.c` and `Lua 5.3.6`).

```sh
# For only building lcfetch, produced binary will be located at 'bin/lcfetch'
make

# If you want to compile using your system's Lua version
make USE_SYSTEM_LUA=1

# For building and installing lcfetch, lcfetch will be installed at '~/.local/bin'
make install
```

> **IMPORTANT**: if you don't have clang installed you will need to change the `CC` variable
> value by adding `CC=gcc` in your make call.

#### Troubleshooting

1. If you're getting errors regarding to missing Lua headers (e.g. `lauxlib.h`)
    change the `LUA variable when running `make` to match your Lua `include/` path,
    e.g. `LUA=lua5.3` for `/usr/include/lua5.3`.

2. If you're getting errors regarding to `ld` and `-llua` you will need to change the
    `LUA` variable when running `make` to match with your `liblua*.so` file, e.g.
    `LUA=lua5.3` for `liblua5.3.so`.

## Usage

For starting lcfetch you will only need to type `lcfetch` in your terminal.

lcfetch also provides a CLI with some options.

```
$ lcfetch --help
Usage: lcfetch [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -c, --config /path/to/config    Specify a path to a custom config file
    -h, --help                      Print this message and exit
    -v, --version                   Show lcfetch version

```

> See `man lcfetch` for more information about usage and configurations.

### Configuring lcfetch

lcfetch uses the [Lua scripting language](https://www.lua.org/) as its configuration
language.

When installing lcfetch with `GNU Make` we will automatically copy the default configurations
under the default configurations path for lcfetch (`~/.config/lcfetch/config.lua`).

> **NOTE**: if you didn't installed lcfetch with `make` you will need to copy the file
> by yourself under `~/.config/lcfetch` directory. The default configurations file is
> located under [config](./config) directory in the repository.

All the configuration options are self-documented and easy to understand.

## Uninstalling

For uninstalling lcfetch you can simply run `make uninstall` in the lcfetch directory.

This command will remove the lcfetch binary from `~/.local/bin` directory and also
the lcfetch man pages from `~/.local/share/man/man1` and refresh your `mandb` to
completely remove them.

  extract the ASCII distribution logos from `neofetch`.
- [rxi](https://github.com/rxi), lcfetch is using his [log.c](https://github.com/rxi/log.c)
  library for providing error logs in a fancy way.

## Todo

- [ ] Support for some missing essential fields (e.g. `Packages` and `DE`/`WM`)
- [ ] Stop hardcoding the ASCII distro logo and accent color
- [ ] Add more configurations
- [x] Strip content on non-wide terminals if we need to (like neofetch)
- [ ] Add support for MacOS (probably the last thing to be done?)
- [ ] Add support for images (we can use icat, Ã¼zerbug or kitty protocols)
